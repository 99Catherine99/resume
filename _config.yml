I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, specializing in **Operational Research and Causal Statistics**. My research focuses on **Algorithmic Fairness** and **Causality**, with applications in **Credit Scoring**, and I have a strong interest in **Algorithmic Explainability**. 

Throughout my academic journey, I have contributed to a variety of research projects and completed advanced training courses. Notably, I have played a key role in developing dynamic tourism tax models and conducted comprehensive analyses of urban financial economies, among other impactful endeavors.

If you would like to connect or learn more about my work, please feel free to reach out.

          Developed a dynamic tourism tax model for Edinburgh, recognizing the delicate balance between taxation and tourism revenue. The model addresses the challenge where excessively high taxes could deter visitors, leading to a decline in overall tourism revenue, while overly low taxes fail to generate sufficient government income. By implementing adaptable tax rates based on seasonal demand, event-specific surcharges, and a tiered structure for accommodation types and stay durations, the framework aims to optimize revenue without compromising visitor numbers. This approach ensures a sustainable balance, maximizing both government income and the economic benefits of tourism.

	  - **Seasonal Variations:**  
         Integrated the cyclical nature of tourism by incorporating seasonal patterns into the analysis to better reflect fluctuations in demand.  

- **Pandemic Impact:**  
  Utilized dummy variables to account for the effects of the pandemic, ensuring the model captures shifts in tourism trends caused by external shocks.  

- **Accommodation Types:**  
  Developed separate models to analyze the outcomes for three distinct accommodation categories, including budget accommodations, allowing for tailored insights and recommendations.  

- **Economic Time Series Models:**  
  Based the analysis on established time series models in economics, with a focus on ARMA, to provide robust and reliable results.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
